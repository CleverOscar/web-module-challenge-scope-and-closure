 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 *    declaring counter1 holding a function where inside the function we declare a count variable, returning count increamented by 1 when the function is called, but everytime the function is called
 *    count variable resets to 0, counter2 is decalaring a function returning count variable incremented by 1 but does not reset the variable since it is outside of its scope.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 *    counter1 is using closure since we are returning a callback function within counterMaker function. 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *    Counter1 would work more when you are trying to get a single repeated answer everytime the function is called, counter2 increments the variable by one everytime it is called.
 *

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that returns a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

function inning(/*Code Here*/){

    /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/ 

function finalScore(/*code Here*/){

  /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(3) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:
1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
